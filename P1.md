## Project: **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
***
In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip "raw-lines-example.mp4" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. 

Once you have a result that looks roughly like "raw-lines-example.mp4", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.

In addition to implementing code, there is a brief writeup to complete. The writeup should be completed in a separate file, which can be either a markdown file or a pdf document. There is a [write up template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_template.md) that can be used to guide the writing process. Completing both the code in the Ipython notebook and the writeup template will cover all of the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view) for this project.

Let's have a look at our first image called 'test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg'.  Run the 2 cells below (hit Shift-Enter or the "play" button above) to display the image.

**Note: If, at any point, you encounter frozen display windows or other confounding issues, you can always start again with a clean slate by going to the "Kernel" menu above and selecting "Restart & Clear Output".**

---

**The tools you have are color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Tranform line detection.  You  are also free to explore and try other techniques that were not presented in the lesson.  Your goal is piece together a pipeline to detect the line segments in the image, then average/extrapolate them and draw them onto the image for display (as below).  Once you have a working pipeline, try it out on the video stream below.**

**Run the cell below to import some packages.  If you get an `import error` for a package you've already installed, try changing your kernel (select the Kernel menu above --> Change Kernel).  Still have problems?  Try relaunching Jupyter Notebook from the terminal prompt.  Also, see [this forum post](https://carnd-forums.udacity.com/cq/viewquestion.action?spaceKey=CAR&id=29496372&questionTitle=finding-lanes---import-cv2-fails-even-though-python-in-the-terminal-window-has-no-problem-with-import-cv2) for more troubleshooting tips.**  

## Import Packages


```python
#importing some useful packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
import numpy as np
import cv2
%matplotlib inline
```

## Read in an Image


```python
#reading in an image
image = mpimg.imread('test_images/solidWhiteCurve.jpg')

#printing out some stats and plotting
print('This image is:', type(image), 'with dimensions:', image.shape)
plt.imshow(image)  # if you wanted to show a single color channel image called 'gray', for example, call as plt.imshow(gray, cmap='gray')
```

    This image is: <class 'numpy.ndarray'> with dimensions: (540, 960, 3)

## Ideas for Lane Detection Pipeline

**Some OpenCV functions (beyond those introduced in the lesson) that might be useful for this project are:**

`cv2.inRange()` for color selection  
`cv2.fillPoly()` for regions selection  
`cv2.line()` to draw lines on an image given endpoints  
`cv2.addWeighted()` to coadd / overlay two images
`cv2.cvtColor()` to grayscale or change color
`cv2.imwrite()` to output images to file  
`cv2.bitwise_and()` to apply a mask to an image

**Check out the OpenCV documentation to learn about these and discover even more awesome functionality!**

## Helper Functions

## Test Images

Build your pipeline to work on the images in the directory "test_images"  
**You should make sure your pipeline works well on these images before you try the videos.**


```python
import os
imgs = []
for img in os.listdir("test_images/"):
    pos_global_slopes = pos_global_intercepts = neg_global_slopes = neg_global_intercepts = np.array([])
    top_y = np.array([])
    test_image = mpimg.imread('test_images/'+img)
    t = process_image(test_image)
    plt.imshow(t)
    plt.show()

```

## Build a Lane Finding Pipeline



Build the pipeline and run your solution on all test_images. Make copies into the `test_images_output` directory, and you can use the images in your writeup report.

Try tuning the various parameters, especially the low and high Canny thresholds as well as the Hough lines parameters.

The below code was just for debugging lane finding pipeline for images. I use process_image function itself in the end for finding lanes in images as well.


```python
pos_global_slopes = pos_global_intercepts = neg_global_slopes = neg_global_intercepts = np.array([])

converted = yellow_to_white(image)
#plt.imshow(converted)

# TODO: Build your pipeline that will draw lane lines on the test_images
gray = cv2.cvtColor(converted, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
#plt.imshow(gray, cmap='Greys_r')

kernel_size = 3
blur_gray = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray,(kernel_size, kernel_size), 0)
#plt.imshow(blur_gray, cmap='Greys_r')

low_threshold = 60
high_threshold = 180
edges = cv2.Canny(blur_gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)

#plt.imshow(edges, cmap='Greys_r')

# Next we'll create a masked edges image using cv2.fillPoly()
mask = np.zeros_like(edges)   
ignore_mask_color = 255   

# This time we are defining a four sided polygon to mask
imshape = image.shape
vertices = np.array([[(80,imshape[0]),(450, 318), (530, 318), (900,imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)
cv2.fillPoly(mask, vertices, ignore_mask_color)
masked_edges = cv2.bitwise_and(edges, mask)

#plt.imshow(masked_edges, cmap='Greys_r')

# Define the Hough transform parameters
# Make a blank the same size as our image to draw on
rho = 1 # distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid
theta = np.pi/180 # angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid
threshold = 25     # minimum number of votes (intersections in Hough grid cell)
min_line_length = 40 #minimum number of pixels making up a line
max_line_gap = 40    # maximum gap in pixels between connectable line segments


# Run Hough on edge detected image
# Output "lines" is an array containing endpoints of detected line segments
line_image = hough_lines(masked_edges, rho, theta, threshold,
                            min_line_length, max_line_gap)

#plt.imshow(line_image)

        
# Create a "color" binary image to combine with line image
lines_edges = weighted_img(line_image, image)
#plt.imshow(lines_edges)

    
#cv2.imwrite('test_images/solidWhiteCurve_out.jpg', lines_edges)


# then save them to the test_images directory.
```




    True

## Test on Videos

You know what's cooler than drawing lanes over images? Drawing lanes over video!

We can test our solution on two provided videos:

`solidWhiteRight.mp4`

`solidYellowLeft.mp4`

**Note: if you get an `import error` when you run the next cell, try changing your kernel (select the Kernel menu above --> Change Kernel).  Still have problems?  Try relaunching Jupyter Notebook from the terminal prompt. Also, check out [this forum post](https://carnd-forums.udacity.com/questions/22677062/answers/22677109) for more troubleshooting tips.**

**If you get an error that looks like this:**
```
NeedDownloadError: Need ffmpeg exe. 
You can download it by calling: 
imageio.plugins.ffmpeg.download()
```
**Follow the instructions in the error message and check out [this forum post](https://carnd-forums.udacity.com/display/CAR/questions/26218840/import-videofileclip-error) for more troubleshooting tips across operating systems.**

# My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. 

1. First, I converted yellow color to white in the image since the thresholds we have set for Canny edge detection is wrt to white color

2. Next I converted the images to gray scale images followed by Gaussian Blurring

3. Next I run Canny transform to detect the edges

4. Select the of region of interest. 

5. Compute and draw lines on the masked image using Hough transform

6. In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function as follows:

    * To identify if a line belongs to the left lane marking or the right lane marking, I check the slope of each line. If the slope of the line is negetive, it means that the line belongs to the left side. If the slope of the line is positive, it means that the line belongs to rightlane.
    
    * I define 4 global arrays to hold slopes and y intercept of left and right side lane lines
    
    * For each line, slope and y intercept are stored in respective array
    
    * Additionally I have added a check to see if each new slope is within a certain bracket of the mean value. Only if that is the case, I append it to the array.
    
    * Then I find the mean of poitive slope and y intercept and also of negetive slope and y intercept
    
    * This gives us an averaged parameters of left and right line segments. The same paramters are used to draw final smoothed and extrapolated lane lines on left and right side
    
    * To extrapolate the ends of the line, I consider the y points at top and bottom to be constant
    
    * Y bottom is considered to be image.shape[0] and Y top is considered to be 325 which is the value I chose for upper bound of region of interest
    
    * Using these values and the average slope and y intercept, I compute the final extrapolated line



```python
# Import everything needed to edit/save/watch video clips

```python
def process_image(image):
    # NOTE: The output you return should be a color image (3 channel) for processing video below
    # TODO: put your pipeline here,

    converted = yellow_to_white(image)
    #plt.imshow(converted)
    
    gray_image = grayscale(converted)
    
    kernel_size = 5
    blur_gray = gaussian_blur(gray_image, kernel_size)
    
    low_threshold = 60
    high_threshold = 180
    
    edges = canny(blur_gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)

    
    imshape = image.shape
    vertices = np.array([[(40,imshape[0]),(450, 325), (500, 325), (900,imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)
    
    masked_edges = region_of_interest(edges, vertices)
    
    
    # Define the Hough transform parameters
    # Make a blank the same size as our image to draw on
    rho = 2 # distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid
    theta = np.pi/180 # angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid   
    threshold = 25     # minimum number of votes (intersections in Hough grid cell)
    min_line_len = 30 #minimum number of pixels making up a line
    max_line_gap = 35    # maximum gap in pixels between connectable line segments
    
    edges_lines = hough_lines(masked_edges, rho, theta, threshold, min_line_len, max_line_gap)    
    
    
    result = weighted_img(edges_lines, image, α=0.8, β=1., λ=0.)
    
    return result


```

Let's try the one with the solid white lane on the right first ...


```python
pos_global_slopes = pos_global_intercepts = neg_global_slopes = neg_global_intercepts =  np.array([])
white_output = 'test_videos_output/solidWhiteRight.mp4'
## To speed up the testing process you may want to try your pipeline on a shorter subclip of the video
## To do so add .subclip(start_second,end_second) to the end of the line below
## Where start_second and end_second are integer values representing the start and end of the subclip
## You may also uncomment the following line for a subclip of the first 5 seconds
## clip1 = VideoFileClip("test_videos/solidWhiteRight.mp4").subclip(0,5)
clip1 = VideoFileClip("test_videos/solidWhiteRight.mp4")
white_clip = clip1.fl_image(process_image) #NOTE: this function expects color images!!
%time white_clip.write_videofile(white_output, audio=False)

## Improve the draw_lines() function

**At this point, if you were successful with making the pipeline and tuning parameters, you probably have the Hough line segments drawn onto the road, but what about identifying the full extent of the lane and marking it clearly as in the example video (P1_example.mp4)?  Think about defining a line to run the full length of the visible lane based on the line segments you identified with the Hough Transform. As mentioned previously, try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines. You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".**

**Go back and modify your draw_lines function accordingly and try re-running your pipeline. The new output should draw a single, solid line over the left lane line and a single, solid line over the right lane line. The lines should start from the bottom of the image and extend out to the top of the region of interest.**

Now for the one with the solid yellow lane on the left. This one's more tricky!


```python
pos_global_slopes = pos_global_intercepts = neg_global_slopes = neg_global_intercepts =  np.array([])
yellow_output = 'test_videos_output/solidYellowLeft.mp4'
## To speed up the testing process you may want to try your pipeline on a shorter subclip of the video
## To do so add .subclip(start_second,end_second) to the end of the line below
## Where start_second and end_second are integer values representing the start and end of the subclip
## You may also uncomment the following line for a subclip of the first 5 seconds
##clip2 = VideoFileClip('test_videos/solidYellowLeft.mp4').subclip(0,5)
clip2 = VideoFileClip('test_videos/solidYellowLeft.mp4')

# Potential Shortcomings:
1. One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when the vehicle is on a sharp curve. In this case, the lines formed after hough transform would not be continuous. It would result in multiple small lines depending on Hough transform parameters. This means it will not be a smooth curve.  

2. Another shortcoming could be when the vehicle is veering too much to the extreme left or right of the lane, then the other side lane marking may not be detected.We have a fixed region of interest

3. Another shortcoming I observed is that there are lot of cases, especially with images or videos containing yellow lane markers, where horizontal lines are detected after Hough transform(y1 = y2). This means there is a loss of informatino since we cannot use results with y1=y2

# Improvements Suggestions: 
  1. A possible improvement would be to use clothoid equation instead of straight line equation 

  2. Another potential improvement would be with respect to correct lane detection when system vehicle is veering to left or right. Since we have fixed regionof interest, other side lane lines may not be detected when the vehicle is to the extreme right edge of lane (and vice versa). We could increase the region of interest size but that could result in unwanted lines being detected.
  
  3. Need to figure out why this happens and how to resolve.

## Writeup and Submission

If you're satisfied with your video outputs, it's time to make the report writeup in a pdf or markdown file. Once you have this Ipython notebook ready along with the writeup, it's time to submit for review! Here is a [link](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_template.md) to the writeup template file.


## Optional Challenge

Try your lane finding pipeline on the video below.  Does it still work?  Can you figure out a way to make it more robust?  If you're up for the challenge, modify your pipeline so it works with this video and submit it along with the rest of your project!


```python
challenge_output = 'test_videos_output/challenge.mp4'
## To speed up the testing process you may want to try your pipeline on a shorter subclip of the video
## To do so add .subclip(start_second,end_second) to the end of the line below
## Where start_second and end_second are integer values representing the start and end of the subclip
## You may also uncomment the following line for a subclip of the first 5 seconds
##clip3 = VideoFileClip('test_videos/challenge.mp4').subclip(0,5)
clip3 = VideoFileClip('test_videos/challenge.mp4')
challenge_clip = clip3.fl_image(process_image)
%time challenge_clip.write_videofile(challenge_output, audio=False)
```
